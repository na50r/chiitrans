# Purpose of Fork
I forked this repo because I use Chiitrans myself and since the code was available, I wanted to learn more about it and play with it. The main goals of this for are:
* Remove depreciated features (e.g. text hooking, people use [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) these days...) 
* Understand parsing algorithm
* Understand code structure in general 

# Chiitrans Lite
Chiitrans Lite is an automatic translation tool for Japanese visual novels. It extracts, parses and translates text into English on the fly.

Chiitrans Lite is the successor of the project [Chiitrans](http://code.google.com/p/chiitrans/).

* Japanese proper names dictionary ([JMnedict](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/enamdict_doc.html)) support
* Improved parsing algorithm
* PO files support
* ATLAS Environment setting
* Lots of usability improvements

## Removed features
* Translation to languages other than English.
* Parsing: MeCab support
* Parsing: WWWJDIC support
* No arbitrary text replacements
* No user dictionary words (except names)
* No crowdsourced translations
* "Fullscreen" mode

* Windows XP or later
* .NET Framework 4
* Internet Explorer 8+
* 250 MB of free memory

## Recommended
* Windows 7 or later
* .NET Framework 4
* Internet Explorer 10+

* [Translation Aggregator](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/94395-Translation-Aggregator-v0-4-9) - Insight for ATLAS integration, conjugations list, and more. Many thanks to author!
* [AGTH](https://sites.google.com/site/agthook/) - A text extraction tool used in the previous version of Chiitrans. In this version, AGTH is only needed for launching programs using AppLocale without annoying dialog boxes.
* [ITH](http://code.google.com/p/interactive-text-hooker/) - Original text extraction engine
* [Visual Nover Reader](https://code.google.com/p/annot-player/) - Modified text extraction engine (vnr\*.dll). The project is huge, I have used only these dll files from this project.
* [Locale Emulator](https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator) - An AppLocale alternative
