# Update Scripts
### Requirements
* wget (Figure out yourself how to install it, I used chocolatey)
* gunzip (You can also use WinRar, 7z)

### Usage
```
bash script.sh
```
Will download latest JMdict and JMnedict files, unzip them and store the XML files in current directory.
The scripts `latest_local.sh` and `latest_remote.sh` just run basic commands to check the versions of the dictionary.
